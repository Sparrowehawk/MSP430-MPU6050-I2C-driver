# I2C driver for MSP430G2553 with an MPU6050

A very basic I2C driver for an MPU6050 for an MSP430, the code is pretty appendable for a generic I2C device to communicate with an MSP430 in some files.

## Parts used
- MSP430G2553
- MPU6050 (currently only supports one)
- Logic analyzer


For inclusion reasons, I'll try my best to not use master/slave terminology.
